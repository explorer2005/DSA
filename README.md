a<<b=a*2^b
a>>b=a/2^b<br>
range is from -2^31 to 2^21-1
but in unsigned first space can be used to store the data as we know its already positive and the range will be then 2^32-1
Arrays are always passed by reference as the change can be seen in main function

in a n ddecimal  number maximum binaru digits are logn (base 2)+1

in pass by reference we can pass by pointer so we need to change *with same name and we can also pass with alias in which &different name.

Arrays are termed as constant pointers 

while arithmetic operations in pointers the value equal to the bit of the type of variable is added or subtracted 

Binary search is applicable only on sorted arrays
while calculating mid use ((s+(e-s)/2)) it is so because if s+e/2 is used and s=e=INT_MAX then the condition will overflow.
Time complexity of BS is O(logn)
Space complexity is also O(logn)

2 pointer approach is generally used where we need to tackal the 2 values at the same time.

sorted array ha to binary array ek baar zaroor click karna chaiya

In rotated array check wether to search in right or left and one part will be sorted 

in binary search first find out s and e and then apply while loop and find mid and then check the required condition if found correct then thats the answer otherwise find the ways to go to the ans in a repeated manner.
