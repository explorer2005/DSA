# DSA
#Here all  the codes related to DSA will be uploaded<br>
a<<b=a*2^b
a>>b=a/2^b<br>
range is from -2^31 to 2^21-1
but in unsigned first space can be used to store the data as we know its already positive and the range will be then 2^32-1
Arrays are always passed by reference as the change can be seen in main function

in a n ddecimal  number maximum binaru digits are logn (base 2)+1
